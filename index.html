    <h2>This is about me</h2>
    <p>I started my career as a <strong>business analyst</strong> who analysis and plan the core system in insurance company. The system in insurance field should 1) be expressed accurate text, 2)calculate premiums under complicated conditions, and 3)be guided next step fluently because of its nature - <em>complex</em> and <em>complicated</em>. I focused on making an intuitive design as our clients(main users) are over 100,000 people who have different educational background and ages.</p>
